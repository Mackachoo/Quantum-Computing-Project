class Register():
    """ Class to represent the System (Register) at any point in time

    Receives a basis state as its input (can only be initialised as a non-superposed state)
    Main representation is the list self.stateVector where all the coefficients for each basis state are stored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : quantum_states.State
        quantum state dynamically created elsewhere (grovers in our case).

    Attributes
    ----------
    qR : quantum_states.State
        stores the quantum register dynamically created elsewhere.
    stateVector : numpy array
        list of amplitudes and signs for each basis state.
    qbitVector : numpy array
        list of individual basis states.
    Methods
    -------
    applyGate(self, gate)
        operates matrix "gate" on the Register's stateVector
    measure(self)
        returns a basis state of the register randonly, depending on the amplitude of the basis states (does not change the stateVector)
        i.e. the measurement is not realistic
    measure_collapse(self)
        same as measure(self), but actually collapses the register to a basis state (which it returns)
        After the measurement the register is not in a superposition .
    __str__(self)
        string representation of state

    Examples
    --------
    |s> = -0.2|0> + 0.9|1>, has
    self.stateVector = [-0.2, 0.9], and
    self.qbitVector = [Register(0,1), Register(1,1)] (i.e. a list of pure "states" [|0>, |1>])
    __str__ prints: '-0.2|0> + 0.9|1>'
