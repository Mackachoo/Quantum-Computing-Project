# Quantum Computing Project

Quantum computing utilises three basic ingredients inherent to quantum mechanics: superposition, interference and entanglement. 



Quantum  computers  could  spur  the  development  of  new  breakthroughs  in  science, medications  to  save  lives,  machine  learning  methods  to  diagnose  illnesses  sooner, materials  to  make  more  efficient  devices  and  structures,  financial  strategies  to  livewell  in  retirement,  and  algorithms  to  quickly  direct  resources  such  as  ambulances. A thorough understanding of quantum algorithms is crucial for the success of future quantum computers.

## Description

A simulation of a quantum computer was implemented on a classical computer using the Python programming language. All basic components of a quantum computer were created and Groverâ€™s quantum search algorithm was implemented and successfully run.
